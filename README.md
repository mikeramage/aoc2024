# Advent of Code 2024

Well, here we Go!

... Sorry. I'll get my coat.

## Day 1
Another year, another set of puzzles, another ludicrous README, a new programming language. 

Typical Day 1 puzzle, easing you in oh so gently, the calm before the storm. Spent most of my 
time setting up a framework for running the code. Go is a curious beast. Considerably less 
painful than Rust to learn, yet missing a lot of its pretty features. Syntax somewhere between C 
and Python. Error handling seems very verbose (i.e. if err != nil everywhere). For this puzzle I wanted to 
zip() a couple of lists together a la Python, but it doesn't exist, so I've got a C-style for loop 
over indices, which feels a bit old-skool, but whatever. Reading lines from a file was a bit funky.
Open a file, handle failure, create a scanner, scan the lines. I dunno, it all feels a bit like teaching 
my parents how the internet works. A lot of words, seemingly unnecessary repetition, not really sure if 
they (or I) have really understood it all. 

Still, 2 stars is 2 stars and I quite enjoyed mucking about with cobra-cli. Onwards and upwards. Roll on 
Day 2!
